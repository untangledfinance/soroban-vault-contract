# Threat Modeling for Vault Contract

This document provides a STRIDE-based threat analysis for the Vault contract. STRIDE stands for **Spoofing**, **Tampering**, **Repudiation**, **Information Disclosure**, **Denial of Service**, and **Elevation of Privilege**. Each category is analyzed to identify potential threats and propose mitigations.

---

## 1. Spoofing

**Threat:** An attacker impersonates a legitimate user (e.g., seller, buyer, or treasury) to perform unauthorized actions.

### Vulnerable Areas:
- Functions like `initialize`, `deposit`, `claim_leftover`, `updt_price`, `redeem_request`, `cancel_request`, `claim_request`, and `setle_epoch` rely on `require_auth()` for user authentication.
- If `require_auth()` is bypassed or misused, unauthorized users could impersonate legitimate users.

### Mitigation:
- Ensure `require_auth()` is correctly implemented and used in all functions requiring user authentication.
- Use strong cryptographic mechanisms for address verification.

---

## 2. Tampering

**Threat:** An attacker modifies the contract state or data (e.g., offers, redemption requests, or token balances).

### Vulnerable Areas:
- Direct manipulation of storage keys like `DataKey::Offer`, `DataKey::TotalRedeem`, and `DataKey::EpochId`.
- Functions like `write_offer`, `write_redeem_request`, and `delete_redeem_request` could be exploited if not properly secured.

### Mitigation:
- Ensure all state-modifying functions are protected by proper authorization checks.
- Use immutable data structures where possible to prevent unauthorized modifications.

---

## 3. Repudiation

**Threat:** A user denies performing an action, such as depositing tokens or submitting a redemption request.

### Vulnerable Areas:
- Functions like `deposit`, `redeem_request`, and `claim_request` involve user actions that could be repudiated.

### Mitigation:
- Emit events (e.g., `vault_deposit`, `vault_redeem_request`, `vault_claim_request`) for all critical actions to create an immutable audit trail.
- Ensure event logs are stored securely and are tamper-proof.

---

## 4. Information Disclosure

**Threat:** Sensitive information, such as user balances or redemption requests, is exposed to unauthorized parties.

### Vulnerable Areas:
- Functions like `get_offer`, `get_request`, `get_epoch_id`, and `get_total_redeem` expose contract state.
- If these functions are not restricted, sensitive data could be leaked.

### Mitigation:
- Restrict access to sensitive read functions where necessary.
- Avoid storing sensitive information in plaintext within the contract.

---

## 5. Denial of Service (DoS)

**Threat:** An attacker disrupts the contract's functionality, preventing legitimate users from interacting with it.

### Vulnerable Areas:
- Functions like `setle_epoch` and `claim_request` could be targeted with large inputs or repeated calls to exhaust gas or storage.
- Overflows in calculations (e.g., `checked_add`, `checked_mul`) could lead to panics, disrupting contract execution.

### Mitigation:
- Use `unwrap_optimized()` and other safe arithmetic methods to handle overflows gracefully.
- Implement rate-limiting or gas-efficient mechanisms to prevent abuse of critical functions.

---

## 6. Elevation of Privilege

**Threat:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to privileged actions, such as updating prices or settling epochs.

### Vulnerable Areas:
- Functions like `updt_price` and `setle_epoch` rely on `require_auth()` to restrict access to the seller or treasury.
- If `require_auth()` is bypassed, attackers could perform privileged actions.

### Mitigation:
- Ensure `require_auth()` is strictly enforced for all privileged actions.
- Use role-based access control (RBAC) to clearly define and enforce user roles.

## Summary of Mitigations

1. **Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Use `require_auth()` consistently and correctly.
   - Implement role-based access control for privileged actions.

2. **Event Logging:**
   - Emit events for all critical actions to maintain an audit trail.

3. **Data Integrity:**
   - Protect storage keys and ensure state-modifying functions are secure.
   - Use safe arithmetic methods to prevent overflows.

4. **Access Control:**
   - Restrict access to sensitive read functions.
   - Avoid exposing unnecessary contract state.

5. **Resilience:**
   - Implement gas-efficient mechanisms to prevent DoS attacks.
   - Validate inputs to prevent abuse or unexpected behavior.

By addressing these potential threats, the Vault contract can be made more secure and resilient against attacks.
